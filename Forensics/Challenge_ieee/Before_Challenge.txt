Forensic CTF Challenges 

These are some CTFs in the Forensics Category.
The flag format is flagN{}, where N is a number.
There are a total of 5 flags, and each challenge comes with a description.

For your convenience I suggest solving them with a linux terminal , 
wether that is wsl , virtual box or Main linux machine.

Solving them on windows is possible but a bit more difficult .

Finding online tools is higly encouraged.

Have fun !!
