Python idle

What a brilliant idea an emploee had !!
Make a programm to run python commands like an idle and leave it open on the system!
Of course he thought it was a good idea to leave vital information inside the code


To run :

On a linux Machine 
Either build the container with
./docker_create_image.sh
and then ./run_docker_level1.sh


On Any Machine
Or just run ./python_shell_level_1.py
